%h1 Proposing a Story

%p If this is too restrictive, you can use the #{link_to 'advanced form', new_story_path(advanced: true)}.

%section.add-story
  = form_for @story, as: :story, url: stories_path, method: :post, html: { class: 'new_story fill_in' } do |f|
    = render partial: 'shared/story_fields', locals: {form: f}
    .line
      .flash.notice This story will be added to the icebox and be discussed in an upcoming Pre-IPM.
      = f.button
