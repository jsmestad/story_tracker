## Frequently Asked Questions

Below are a list of questions we often get from users of StoryTracker.

### Why do only select stories appear as links?

The answer to this is the same as it is to "Why can I not search all stories?".

Links only appear for stories submitted through StoryTracker. This provides a
barrier between day-to-day engineering tasks and stakeholder requests.

### Why are the submission forms so restrictive?

The restrictive nature of the forms is **very intentional**. The aim is the
questions are focused on getting to the essence of what a request is aimed to
resolve and leaves out the details.

This translates to a much quicker turnaround time on submissions. Asking for all
the details up front isn't a good use of time if a request in the end isn't a
priority.

### Who is the target audience for this application?

StoryTracker is aimed at personnel outside of the day-to-day development
process. These people may be non-engineers inside of an organization or
external customers.

### Why can I not search all stories?

Search only looks for stories submitted through StoryTracker. This provides a
barrier between day-to-day engineering tasks and stakeholder requests.

### Where are the submission buttons? I cannot see them.

By default new users only have view-only permissions on their account. If you
are looking to submit requests you have to contact your StoryTracker
administrator and have them grant write access.

### What is a "defect"?

A defect is a regression plain and simple. You may now be thinking "Oh that's a
bug, why not just call it that?" - Well we've found most people tend to confuse
the bug and feature terminology so we've opted for a more unique term to
describe a regression, "a defect".

### I submitted a request, but it's not showing up in Pivotal Tracker. What's going on?

StoryTracker has a submission review process. Upon submission the administrators
are sent an email notification requesting they review it. This can take a bit of
time depending on the team. - If something is urgent, it's best to reach out and
ping your administrator directly.

### Why am I not getting email notifications?

You must have your email address configured in your account settings in order to
receive email notifications.

### Why are my submissions showing up in Pivotal Tracker with a different owner?

This is because you do not have your Pivotal Tracker API token set. This can be
set through the account settings page.
