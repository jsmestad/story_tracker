## Explaining the Submission Workflow

This page aims to explain the states a request (both features and defects) submission
goes through on its way to resolution.

### Pending Review

All requests are placed in a "Pending Review" state after submission. They will
not appear in Pivotal Tracker until a StoryTracker administrator reviews the
submission. All StoryTracker administrators are notified via email (if
configured) explaining a new submission is ready for review.

Depending on the organization, submission volume, and process, the submission review process may take quite awhile. If something is urgent, we suggest reaching out directly to StoryTracker administrators to convey a desire for escalation.

### Rejected

When reviewing submissions, the StoryTracker administrator has the option to
reject a submission. The reasons for this may be many but often means there
could be duplicates, lack sufficient information, or other priorities
taking precedent over this submission.

If a submission is rejected, it is updated and closed out. The submitter will
receive a notification via email, if configured.

It is important to note that submissions can be moved to rejected status at
any step along this process.

### Approved

If the StoryTracker administrator feels a submission meets organizational
criteria, they will approve it. This sends the submission as-is to the Pivotal
Tracker icebox. For those unfamiliar with Pivotal Tracker, the icebox is a
discussion queue for any upcoming prioritization meetings.

This does not mean a submission will be resolved and acted upon, but it does
mean the submission is worth a organization discussion about.

From this point if the submitter has configured their email address they will
receive email notifications as their submission progresses through the Pivotal
Tracker workflow.
